## üê≥ Docker Setup (Use Docker to Run Frontend & Backend Locally)

If you want to run both the **React frontend** and **Spring Boot backend** using **Docker** without manually setting up the environment, follow these steps:

### 1. **Install Docker**

Make sure Docker is installed on your system. If you haven't installed Docker yet, follow the instructions for your operating system:

- **Windows**: [Install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
- **macOS**: [Install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
- **Linux**: [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

After installing Docker, open a terminal and check the installation by running:

```bash
docker --version
```

### Login to Docker Hub

Before pulling Docker images from Docker Hub, you need to log in to your Docker Hub account. Run the following command:

```bash
docker login
```

### Pull Docker Images

To get the pre-built images for both frontend and backend, you can pull them from Docker Hub (assuming you've already pushed your images there). Run the following commands:

```bash
docker pull codeadmin870/chat-bot:02
```

### Run Docker Containers

To run the containers locally, use the following commands. We'll expose the frontend on port 5173 and the backend on port 8088.

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 codeadmin870/chat-bot:02
```
